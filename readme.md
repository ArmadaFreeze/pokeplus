## About

This repository contains a **decompiled version of a bot for PokeMMO+**, a popular third-party automation tool for the PokeMMO game. PokeMMO+ bots provide automated gameplay features such as farming, battling, and trading to simplify player experience.

## What is PokeMMO and PokeMMO+?

- **PokeMMO** is a fan-made massively multiplayer online Pokémon game combining regions and gameplay from official Pokémon titles like FireRed, Emerald, Platinum, HeartGold, and Black. It offers a shared world where players trade, battle, and explore together in real-time.
- **PokePlus (PokeMMO+)** is a third-party platform offering bots and automation tools for PokeMMO gameplay. These bots automate repetitive in-game tasks including leveling, catching Pokémon, and farming items.

## About This Decompiled Bot Project

- This project contains the **decompiled C# source code of a PokeMMO+ bot client**.
- The original bot was compiled and obfuscated; this repository provides a reverse-engineered approximation of the source code.
- Some code elements have generic or autogenerated names due to decompilation and obfuscation.
- The bot automates gameplay and simplifies playing PokeMMO but may violate the game’s terms of service.
